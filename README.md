## Description

Basically, what I want to do with this project is create a small game, at least one part of it.
This small game will be made with ElectronJS, and the player's XYZ data, username, deaths, and items owned will be sent to a PostgreSQL database connected to this site.

To develop this project, I'm basing the beginning of the game on the seinen manga Berserk, specifically the idea of the [`'coffin birth'`](https://apieceofanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/guts-birth.jpg?w=449&h=310).

## Commands

In order to install this project, `CRTL`+`SHIFT`+`ù` or open a new powershell terminal.

```bash
    npm install --save-dev vite
```
```bash
    npm run dev
```

## Addons
I'll try to create a file that installs [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.pgadmin.org/download) on your device and creates a database with tables similar to mine, as well as an .env file to facilitate the creation of new projects.
